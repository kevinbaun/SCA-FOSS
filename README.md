# SCA-FOSS

This project is dedicated to identifying and organizing Free OpenSource Software (FOSS) that is relevant to the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). 

## FINE PRINT
Whatever you share through the SCA-FOSS initiative has to be FREE. I don't mean 'free for a while'. I don't mean 'in app purchases'. No nags. No ads. No silly tracking. It is recommended that you release your software under one of the generally accepted FOSS licences: General Public License (GPL), the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), etc. The license you use is up to you but it has got to free.
